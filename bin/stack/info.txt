STACK
-----
1. Liner Data Structure
2. Follows LIFO (Last In First Out)
3. 4 basic operations can be performed on stack : 
	i)   Push : Adding elements to the stack at the end of stack
	ii)  Pop  : Removing the last added element from the stack
	iii) Peek : Returns top element of the stack 
	iv)  isEmpty : checks if stack is empty
	All these operations take O(1) time.
4. Top element is the last inserted element
